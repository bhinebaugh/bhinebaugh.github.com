three generations of biofuels

1. food crops: starch or oils corn sugarcane / canola soybean palm
1. 2nd gen. agricultural residues (biomass). hay, grass, trees. (cellulosic) lignin breakdown. technologically demanding.
1. most advanced, in research. algae. requires much energy? (net loss?) research into greater efficiency. aquatic plants more co2 because no tradeoff with water loss transpiration.

food vs fuel!
animal fodder / fertilizer vs fuel!
