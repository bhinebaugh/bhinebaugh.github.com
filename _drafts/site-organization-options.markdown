Some posts are just observations. Or perhaps they include an image as well. But no fancy stuff, loading javascript or special fonts or animating things willy nilly.

Other posts link to a project, and offer comments about how it was implemented (or updated). Usually there'd be a screenshot or thumbnail to accompany the update I guess.

Projects and posts are often inspired by a book or article or report. How best to recognize the source? In the post, in the project, in the YAML

Archetypes, special data collections -- config is convoluted.

custom data (yml front matter)
- subject source (citation)
- technologies used (libraries, links, inspiration)
- technical notes
- photo credits
